# Security Documentation - Inventory Management System

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### User Type Verification
The system implements strict user type verification to ensure proper access control:

1. **Sign-in Verification**: Users must select their correct user type (supplier/vendor) during sign-in
2. **Profile Validation**: User type is verified against the profiles table in the database
3. **Route Protection**: Routes are protected based on user type requirements
4. **API Access Control**: All API endpoints validate user type before allowing access

### Authentication Flow

```javascript
// 1. User selects user type and enters credentials
const { data, error } = await signIn(email, password, userType);

// 2. System verifies user type from profiles table
const profile = await verifyUserType(userId, expectedUserType);

// 3. Access is granted only if user type matches
if (profile.user_type !== userType) {
  throw new Error('Invalid user type');
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Access Control Matrix

### Supplier Access
- **Dashboard**: ‚úÖ Full access to supplier dashboard
- **Inventory**: ‚úÖ Manage own products only
- **Reports**: ‚úÖ View own sales and inventory reports
- **Orders**: ‚úÖ View and update orders they're involved in
- **Vendor Pages**: ‚ùå No access to vendor-specific pages

### Vendor Access
- **Dashboard**: ‚úÖ Full access to vendor dashboard
- **Products**: ‚úÖ View active products from all suppliers
- **Orders**: ‚úÖ Create and manage own orders
- **Supplier Pages**: ‚ùå No access to supplier-specific pages

## üîí Database Security

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

#### Profiles Table
```sql
-- Users can only access their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Users can update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON profiles
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Users can insert their own profile during signup
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile" ON profiles
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
```

#### Products Table
```sql
-- Suppliers can manage their own products
CREATE POLICY "Suppliers can manage their own products" ON products
  FOR ALL USING (supplier_id = auth.uid());

-- Vendors can view active products
CREATE POLICY "Vendors can view active products" ON products
  FOR SELECT USING (is_active = true);
```

#### Orders Table
```sql
-- Users can view their own orders
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own orders" ON orders
  FOR SELECT USING (vendor_id = auth.uid() OR supplier_id = auth.uid());

-- Vendors can create orders
CREATE POLICY "Vendors can create orders" ON orders
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (vendor_id = auth.uid());

-- Suppliers can update orders they're involved in
CREATE POLICY "Suppliers can update orders they're involved in" ON orders
  FOR UPDATE USING (supplier_id = auth.uid());
```

## üö´ Security Measures

### 1. User Type Validation
- **Frontend**: User type selection required during sign-in
- **Backend**: User type verified against database profile
- **API**: All endpoints validate user type before processing

### 2. Resource Access Control
- **Products**: Suppliers can only access their own products
- **Orders**: Users can only access orders they're involved in
- **Reports**: Users can only view their own data

### 3. Route Protection
```javascript
// Protected routes with user type requirements
<Route 
  path="/supplier/dashboard" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute userType="supplier">
      <SupplierDashboard />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>
```

### 4. API Security
```javascript
// All API calls validate user session and type
const { user } = await validateUserSession('supplier');
await checkResourceAccess(user.id, 'product', productId);
```

## üîç Security Utilities

### validateUserSession()
Validates user authentication and user type:
```javascript
const { user, profile } = await validateUserSession('supplier');
```

### checkResourceAccess()
Verifies user has access to specific resources:
```javascript
await checkResourceAccess(userId, 'product', productId);
await checkResourceAccess(userId, 'order', orderId);
```

### verifyUserType()
Verifies user type matches expected type:
```javascript
const profile = await verifyUserType(userId, 'supplier');
```

## üö® Security Best Practices

### 1. Input Validation
- All form inputs are validated on both frontend and backend
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through proper input sanitization

### 2. Session Management
- JWT tokens managed by Supabase Auth
- Automatic session expiration
- Secure token storage

### 3. Error Handling
- Generic error messages to prevent information leakage
- Proper error logging for debugging
- Graceful error handling in UI

### 4. Data Protection
- All sensitive data encrypted in transit
- Database backups with encryption
- Regular security audits

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Supabase Configuration
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Database Security Settings
- RLS enabled on all tables
- Proper user permissions
- Regular security updates
